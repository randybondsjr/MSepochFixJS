## Summary: 
I couldn't find this type of simple function out there, so I made it. All it does is take your MS Epoch string and convert it to an en-us date. You can feel free to fork this to whatever date format/localization you want. 
Feel free to use this code, but it comes with zero guarantee of any kind.
